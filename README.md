# ThundersPi-SpringBoot
This is the backend repo for my E-Learning website project EDUHUB. It is a proof of concept project during school. The project included preparing a cloud environment using Openstack and then deploy this app (along with its front end and database) to it.

This is obviously made using SpringBoot. It contains basic cruds and some advanced functionalities. 

I shall update this project myself in this fork (since the main project was a group project).
